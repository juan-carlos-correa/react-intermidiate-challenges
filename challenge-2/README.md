# React Intermediate Challenge 3 - Auth, Routing, and Global State Management.

For this challenge, you will create a SPA with Authentication and use of Global State Management with the following characteristics:

- The app consists in a clone of [Google keep app](https://keep.google.com/u/0/).
- The app allows you to create different kinds of notes and keep them on the site.

**Note:** We are not going to clone the app completely.

Focus on the following features:

- Access only via authentication using **Email** and **Password**.
- Create a new note through a form with _only_ plain text and color.
- You can update the content and the color of the note.
  You can search for a note through the **Search** input.
- You can archive a note.
- You can navigate through the login page, notes page, and archive page.

## Instructions

1. You can either create a sandbox react app or create a new react app here, as part of the repository.

**Requisites**

- Do _not_ use UI libraries.
- Use React Testing Library and Jest or Vitest tools to complete the tests.
- Use functional components and React Hooks as possible.

### Completing the Challenge

Follow these steps to complete this challenge:

1. Create a new branch with the name `challenge-3` from this repository.
2. Complete all the Acceptance Criteria.

**Note:** We suggest using React Router for navigation and React Context or Redux for Global State Management.
