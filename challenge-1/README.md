# React Intermediate Challenge 2 - Styles, Fetching API, Testing.

For this challenge, you will create an awesome React App which fetches the "Picture of the day" from the NASA open `APOD API`.

## Instructions

1. Create an app from scratch, consider your best UX knowledge for the UI design; it is up to you.
2. You can either create a sandbox react app or create a new react app here, as part of the repository.

**Recommendations**
We recommend you consider the following elements that should contain the app:

- Title
- Date Picker
- Main section with the image

**Requisites**

- Don't use UI Libraries. You have to build your styles. You can use styled-components such as SASS, LESS, or CSS. You are free to use the approach that makes sense to you.
- Fetch API Calls from the `NASA APOD` using your API KEY.
- Publish your app using free services such as Github pages, Netflify, or Heroku.
- Share the URL on the PR.
- Use the React Testing Library and Jest tools to add tests.
- Use functional components and React Hooks as possible.
